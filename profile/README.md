## ⚡ Most Common Cheats & Exploits in [Among Us](https://amongus-online.io/)

### 1. How to Always Be the Impostor

Many players want to play as the impostor every round. While there is no guaranteed method, some believe switching colors or names before a match increases their chances.

### 2. Speed Hack

Some mods allow you to move faster than other players, making it easier to escape after an elimination. However, this is considered cheating and can result in a ban.

### 3. No Kill Cooldown Hack

Impostors usually have a kill cooldown, but some hacks remove this restriction, allowing unlimited eliminations. This is not allowed in fair play.

### 4. Wall Hack & Vision Hack

Some players use cheats to see through walls, making it impossible for crewmates to hide.
